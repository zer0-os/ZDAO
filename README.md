# ZDAO Governance Contract

## Overview

ZDAO is a customizable governance contract built on top of OpenZeppelin's Governor contracts. It provides a robust and flexible framework for decentralized governance, incorporating various extensions for governance settings, voting mechanisms, timelock control, quorum fractions, and late quorum prevention.

By leveraging OpenZeppelin's well-audited and widely-used contracts, ZDAO ensures security and reliability for managing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and other governance-related applications.

## Features

- **GovernorSettings**: Configure voting delay, voting period, and proposal threshold.
- **GovernorCountingSimple**: Simple vote counting mechanism (For, Against, Abstain).
- **GovernorVotes**: Integrate with governance tokens implementing the `IVotes` interface.
- **GovernorTimelockControl**: Manage proposal execution delays using a timelock controller.
- **GovernorVotesQuorumFraction**: Define quorum as a fraction of the total token supply.
- **GovernorPreventLateQuorum**: Prevent last-minute quorum attacks by extending the voting period if quorum is reached late.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Well-documented code for ease of understanding and maintenance.
